## Introduction

This project involves creating malicious nodes to attempt to penetrate a complex peer-to-peer order system, and reason about how any potential vulnerabilities can be solved. These nodes will introduce bad actors into the network and will aim to affect the functioning of the system negatively, either with the intent of gaining more than they spend or causing other nodes to suffer a loss.

This repository will contain any resources used throughout the duration of this project.
