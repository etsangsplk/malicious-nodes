# Planning

## Meeting notes

All of our meeting notes have been placed into the [meeting notes](./meeting-notes) directory.

We will try to reference these notes through out the documentation to explain how we have made certain decisions.

## Task management

A Github issue has been created for each attack, which will be used for discussion about the attack and for tracking task completion regarding the attack.

The Github issues can be found [here](https://github.com/republicprotocol/malicious-nodes/issues) (under both 'Open' and 'Closed'), or linked to from the individual attack READMEs.

The issues will be grouped by the Audit they will be presented as, as well as by their categories.
