# Planning

## Meeting notes

[Link to Meeting Notes](./meeting-notes)

All of our meeting notes will be saved on Github in the `meeting-notes` directory.

We will try to reference these notes through out the documentation to explain how we have made certain decisions.


## Task management

[Link to Issue Dashboard](https://github.com/republicprotocol/malicious-nodes/issues)

A Github issue will be created for each attack, which will be used for discussion about the attack and for tracking task completion regarding the attack.

The Github issues can be found in the Issue Darhboard, under both 'Open' and 'Closed'), or linked to from the individual attack READMEs.

The issues will be grouped by the Audit they will be presented as, as well as by their categories.


## Milestones

[Link to Milestone Dashboard](https://github.com/republicprotocol/malicious-nodes/milestones)

We will be using github for tracking milestones. Each attack will be organised into one of two milestones:

- [ ] Audit 2
- [ ] Audit 3


## Considerations

**Contraints**: The Republic Protocol network is still in active development, and not all of its components are fully implemented. This will mean that we will have to spend some time developing the tools required for testing and evaluating the malicious nodes, as there is no such infrastructure yet.

**Risks**: In order to minimise risks, we will be operating all tests and evaluations on a private test network. This means that traders and node operators will not be affected by any potential network disruption caused by the malicious nodes.

**Resources and Costs**: The only foreseeable cost and required resource will be will be servers for running nodes. Republic Protocol already has access to the infrastructure required for the project.
