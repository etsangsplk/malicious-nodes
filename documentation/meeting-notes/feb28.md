# 28 February 2018

In this meeting, we discussed details about our project with John and categorised the different node into smaller groups.

We decided that creating categories help us identify possible connections and draw connections between diffent attacks. This could help us to improve and combine the different attack vectors, and come up with better attack ideas.

We started planning the project audit, ensuring that we address each of the different criteria.
